  "readme": "# Luxapla core\n\nThis is a library used in [Luxapla](https://luxalpa.org) clients.  Never used directly.  Some of the clients that require the library:\n\n* [Luxapla](../../../luxalpa) - GUI wallet for Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android.\n* [Headless Luxapla](../../../headless-luxalpa) - headless wallet, primarily for server side use.\n* [Luxapla Relay](../../../luxalpa-relay) - relay node for Luxapla network.  It doesn't hold any private keys.\n* [Luxapla Hub](../../../luxalpa-hub) - hub for Luxapla network.  Includes the relay, plus can store and forward end-to-end encrypted messages among devices on the Luxapla network.\n\n## Developer guides\n\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/luxalpa/core/wiki/Luxapla-Developer-Guides).  Many of the features are not documented yet, see other [luxalpa repositories](https://github.com/luxalpa) as samples, for APIs see the `exports` of node.js modules.\n\n## Configuring\n\nThe default settings are in the library's [conf.js](conf.js), they can be overridden in your project root's conf.js (see the clients above as examples), then in conf.json in the app data folder.  The app data folder is:\n\n* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/<appname>`\n* Linux: `~/.config/<appname>`\n* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\<appname>`\n\n`<appname>` is `name` in your `package.json`.\n\n### Settings\n\nThis is the list of some of the settings that the library understands (your app can add more settings that only your app understands):\n\n#### conf.port\n\nThe port to listen on.  If you don't want to accept incoming connections at all, set port to `null`, which is the default.  If you do want to listen, you will usually have a proxy, such as nginx, accept websocket connections on standard port 443 and forward them to your luxalpa daemon that listens on port 6611 on the local interface.\n\n#### conf.storage\n\nStorage backend -- mysql or sqlite, the default is sqlite.  If sqlite, the database files are stored in the app data folder.  If mysql, you need to also initialize the database with [luxalpa.sql](luxalpa.sql) and set connection params, e.g. in conf.json in the app data folder:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"port\": 6611,\n\t\"storage\": \"mysql\",\n\t\"database\": {\n\t\t\"max_connections\": 30,\n\t\t\"host\"     : \"localhost\",\n\t\t\"user\"     : \"luxalpa\",\n\t\t\"password\" : \"yourmysqlpassword\",\n\t\t\"name\"     : \"luxalpa\"\n\t}\n}\n```\n#### conf.bLight\n\nWork as light client (`true`) or full node (`false`).  The default is full client.\n\n#### conf.bServeAsHub\n\nWhether to serve as hub on the Luxapla network (store and forward e2e-encrypted messages for devices that connect to your hub).  The default is `false`.\n\n#### conf.myUrl\n\nIf your node accepts incoming connections, this is its URL.  The node will share this URL with all its outgoing peers so that they can reconnect in any direction in the future.  By default the node doesn't share its URL even if it accepts connections.\n\n#### conf.bWantNewPeers\n\nWhether your node wants to learn about new peers from its current peers (`true`, the default) or not (`false`).  Set it to `false` to run your node in stealth mode so that only trusted peers can see its IP address (e.g. if you have online wallets on your server and don't want potential attackers to learn its IP).\n\n#### conf.socksHost, conf.socksPort, and conf.socksLocalDNS\n\nSettings for connecting through optional SOCKS5 proxy.  Use them to connect through TOR and hide your IP address from peers even when making outgoing connections.  This is useful and highly recommended when you are running an online wallet on your server and want to make it harder for potential attackers to learn the IP address of the target to attack.  Set `socksLocalDNS` to `false` to route DNS queries through TOR as well.\n\n#### MySQL conf for faster syncing\n\nTo lower disk load and increase sync speed, you can optionally disable flushing to disk every transaction, instead doing it once a second. This can be done by setting `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=0` in your MySQL server config file (my.ini)\n\n## Accepting incoming connections\n\nLuxapla network works over secure WebSocket protocol wss://.  To accept incoming connections, you'll need a valid TLS certificate (you can get a free one from [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org)) and a domain name (you can get a free domain from [Freenom](http://www.freenom.com/)).  Then you accept connections on standard port 443 and proxy them to your locally running luxalpa daemon.\n\nThis is an example configuration for nginx to accept websocket connections at wss://luxalpa.one/bb and forward them to locally running daemon that listens on port 6611:\n\nIf your server doesn't support IPv6, comment or delete the two lines containing [::] or nginx won't start\n\n```nginx\nserver {\n\tlisten 80 default_server;\n\tlisten [::]:80 default_server;\n\tlisten 443 ssl;\n\tlisten [::]:443 ssl;\n\tssl_certificate \"/etc/letsencrypt/live/luxalpa.one/fullchain.pem\";\n\tssl_certificate_key \"/etc/letsencrypt/live/luxalpa.one/privkey.pem\";\n\n\tif ($host != \"luxalpa.one\") {\n\t\trewrite ^(.*)$ https://luxalpa.one$1 permanent;\n\t}\n\tif ($https != \"on\") {\n\t\trewrite ^(.*)$ https://luxalpa.one$1 permanent;\n\t}\n\n\tlocation = /bb {\n\t\tproxy_pass http://localhost:6611;\n\t\tproxy_http_version 1.1;\n\t\tproxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n\t\tproxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n\t\tproxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n\t\tproxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n\t}\n\n\troot /var/www/html;\n\tserver_name _;\n}\n```\n\nBy default Node limits itself to 1.76GB the RAM it uses. If you accept incoming connections, you will likely reach this limit and get this error after some time:\n```\nFATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory\n1: node::Abort() [node]\n...\n...\n12: 0x3c0f805c7567\nOut of memory\n```\nTo prevent this, increase the RAM limit by adding `--max_old_space_size=<size>` to the launch command where size is the amount in MB you want to allocate.\n\nFor example `--max-old-space-size=4096`, if your server has at least 4GB available.\n",
